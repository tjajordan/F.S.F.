    <p><b>Why donate as an associate member?</b>

   <br><br>  / As a software developer, free software lets you build and improve on the work of others, as part of a social community â€” built on the principles of sharing.
  <br><br> / As an artist, you can do things with free software that proprietary software does not allow. All free software allows you to use it for any purpose.
 <br><br> /  As a user, free software removes you from the power struggle of proprietary software, where you are able to help yourself and are not dependent on a single developer or company to help you.
 <br><br> /  As a student, you can study and modify the software you use, learning from and enhancing the tools that you use for education.</p></div>
