      <div class="Statement"> <p><b> Copyright and Compliance:<br></b>
          
<br>/ The Free Software Foundation holds the copyright to many GNU packages, such as GCC and GNU Emacs. When hackers contribute to these projects, we ask that they assign their copyright to enable us to enforce the license. Visit our Contributor's FAQ guide to learn more about the process and read our article FSF Copyright Handling to better understand why we take this approach. For any questions about assigning to the FSF, please contact us at assign@gnu.org.
<br>/ Free software is everywhere these days, inside our computers, phones, and even televisions. With so much free software being distributed every day, we have to remain vigilant against potential violations. You can help to make sure that free software is always free by reporting violations to our compliance team.
<br>/ The FSF can only enforce the license on works to which we hold the copyright, but we can still help bring about compliance even when the copyright lies elsewhere. If you need help with enforcement, please don’t hesitate to contact us at license-violation@gnu.org.
<br>/ Many copyright holders seek monetary damages when their license is violated. We do not — we only want violators to come back into compliance, and help repair any harm done to the free software community by their past actions. Because of that, we contact violators directly, and negotiate a strategy with them that best accomplishes those goals. We follow the Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement in all our compliance matters.
